<body><p><em>My life isn't eventful. It is just school, volunteering, piano, and strict parents who won't let me go out for two days in a row. I split up my life into four sections:</em>
<ol>
  <li><strong>My favorites:<strong>My hobbies, music taste, clothing</li>
    <li><strong>My least favorites:</strong>My pet peeves</li>
    <li><strong>Plans for the future (realistic):</strong>What I want to accomplish this year</li>
    <li><strong>Dreams for the future (idealistic)</strong>:What I would do if I was a trillionaire</li></strong></strong></ul>
